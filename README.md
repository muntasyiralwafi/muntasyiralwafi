## <a name="me"></a>ABOUT ME

I am a PhD Student in **Building Science** at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, supervised by [**Dr. Jenn McArthur**](https://www.torontomu.ca/architectural-science/people/faculty/jennifer-mcarthur/). My research focuses on **retrofit feasibility** studying how to make large-scale building retrofits faster, cheaper, and lower in carbon. I study how operational data supports **faster, lower-cost, lower-carbon** retrofit planning across large building portfolios.  

I develop models to estimate disaggregated energy use, envelope thermal performance, and retrofit potential without manual audits or detailed simulations. As part of [**DECODER project**](https://www.concordia.ca/research/volt-age/initiatives/impact-programs/digitalization-for-energy-efficiency-through-commissioning-and-decarbonization-retrofits.html), I build decision-support tools to screen retrofit pathways at scale. My goal is to support data-driven planning for building decarbonization across cities and large portfolios.

Before joining TMU, I completed an **MSc in Architecture** at *Bahcesehir University*, where my thesis *“From Crisis to Resilience: Affordable Housing in Toronto”* examined the link between housing resilience and affordability. I also hold a **BSc in Urban and Regional Planning** from *Yildiz Technical University*. My previous work includes research and project experience with **UN-Habitat**, **Impact Circles**, and **Urban Minds**

**Education:**
- PhD in Building Science, Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada (2025 – Present)
- MSc in Architecture, Bahcesehir University, Turkey (2023 – 2024)
- BSc in Urban and Regional Planning, Yildiz Technical University, Turkey (2017 – 2022)
